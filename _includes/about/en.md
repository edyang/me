> Yet another man.


Hi, I am *@edyang* (Yang, yuanfa), a software engineer & entrepreneur dog, CEO of [C-Base](http://www.cbishi.com). Large three - party payment company [yiji pay](https://www.yiji.com/) soy sauce. I took over mobile projects and universities, the cannon fodder of the era of mobile Internet entrepreneurship, and worked on weekend excursions, O2O driving training, paid visual advertising, paid video social networking, new retail and other failed projects without exception. I can handle code, manage small teams, and have product thinking and design obsessive-compulsive disorder. Lack of money, lack of people, lack of opportunities!.
